//simple comparisons
// ==, <=, >=, =, >, <
//console.log(2 = 1);

//when compare null with zero always the boolean value comes to false 
//except the case of
console.log(null >= 0); // true
console.log(null == 0); //false
//cuz the comparisons convert the null into a number treating it as 0.

//SAME AS UNDEFINED

//In case of === the comparison not only check the values but also check out their data type.
console.log("2" === 1);
